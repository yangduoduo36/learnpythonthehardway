Every if-statement must have an else.

If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.

Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.

Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.

Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
