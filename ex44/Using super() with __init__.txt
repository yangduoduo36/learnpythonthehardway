Using super() with __init__

The most common use of super() is actually in __init__ functions in base classes. This is usually the only place where you need to do some things in a child, then complete the initialization in the parent. Here's a quick example of doing that in the Child:

class Child(Parent):

    def __init__(self, stuff):
        self.stuff = stuff
        super(Child, self).__init__()

This is pretty much the same as the Child.altered example above, except I'm setting some variables in the __init__ before having the Parent initialize with its Parent.__init__.
