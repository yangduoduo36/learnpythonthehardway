## Error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined

### Explanation

Line 8 expects car_pool_capacity, but line 7 has carpool_capacity. It's a typo boo-boo!
